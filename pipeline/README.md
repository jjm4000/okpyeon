# Hanja Hover — data pipeline (Agent A)

Builds the five data files the extension ships with:

```
extension/data/hanja.json      per-character: eumhun, readings, glosses, compounds
extension/data/words.json      per-hanja-spelling words + byHangul reverse index
extension/data/variants.json   variant character -> canonical (traditional) form
extension/data/rr.json         romanization -> hangul, for romanized search
extension/data/decomp.json     character -> its parts, for the Made of row
```

All five are UTF-8 **without BOM** and compact (no indentation, no newlines).
Schemas are defined in `../SPEC.md`; this pipeline is the only thing that may
write to `extension/data/`.

## Requirements

* **Python 3** (built and verified on 3.12.10 — standard library only, no pip
  installs). On this machine the interpreter is at
  `C:\Users\Jesse\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe`.
* **curl** on `PATH` (ships with Windows 10/11).

## Run it

```sh
python build.py
```

From anywhere — paths are resolved relative to the script, not the cwd. On
Windows, if `python` still resolves to the Microsoft Store stub:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\Jesse\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe" D:\Code\Hanja\pipeline\build.py
```

The script does **download-if-missing → parse → emit → verify** in one pass and
takes roughly 30 seconds once the downloads are cached. It exits non-zero if any
verification check fails.

The Translingual and Japanese extracts are used **only to establish variant
links**. Nothing from them is ever displayed: every gloss, reading and eumhun
the extension shows comes from the Korean hanja entry of the *canonical*
character, which the "canonical must exist in hanja.json" rule guarantees. The
Japanese file is read with `gzip` and never decompressed to disk.

### Provenance of the MOE tier table (`lvl` = `m` / `h`)

The 중학교용 / 고등학교용 split of the Ministry of Education's 1,800 기초한자 comes
from the Korean Wikipedia article 「대한민국 중고등학교 기초한자 목록」, fetched as
raw wikitext (`&action=raw`) and cached like any other source. It is **CC BY-SA
4.0** — the same licence the shipped data bundle is already under, so it adds no
new licence surface; attribution is in `extension/data/DATA-LICENSE.md`. The
underlying list is a 교육부 고시 annex, which 저작권법 제7조 excludes from copyright
altogether, so the wiki page is a convenience mirror rather than the rights
source.

The page is a single `wikitable`: one row per 음, two data columns
(중학교용 || 고등학교용), characters separated by the `{{·}}` template. Parsed to
900 + 900 = 1,800 tiers.

**Unihan stays authoritative for membership.** `kKoreanEducationHanja` decides
who is in the 1,800; the wiki table only decides middle vs high. A tier is kept
only for a character Unihan already lists, so the curriculum zones can never be
inflated by the wiki. The two sets disagree on exactly four glyphs — the wiki
table prints the pre-2007 forms 戱/晩/玆/產 where Unihan uses the forms fixed by
교육인적자원부 고시 제2007-79호 (자형 corrections only, no membership change):
戲/晚/茲/産. That four-entry map is hardcoded in `build.py`
(`EDU_TIER_GLYPH_FIX`); after it, the intersection is a clean 1,800 with 0
untiered. If the sources ever diverge, an in-membership character with no tier
is emitted as `a` and a verify anchor fails, so the divergence gets looked at
rather than silently absorbed.

Unlike the other sources, this one is a live wiki page that can be edited, so it
is fetched **without** `curl -C -` resume (a grown page would corrupt a resumed
download); a size mismatch against the remote `Content-Length` re-fetches the
whole 22 KB.

### Provenance of the external frequency list

`ko_full.txt` comes from **hermitdave/FrequencyWords**, which is published under
the **MIT License** (Copyright (c) 2016 Hermit Dave). Its counts are derived
from the **OPUS OpenSubtitles 2018** corpus (opensubtitles.org), distributed by
the OPUS project for research use; OPUS asks that the corpus be cited rather
than restricting reuse, and the derived frequency counts here are plain
word/count pairs, not subtitle text.

It is a **build-time signal only**. It decides one boolean — the `rare` flag on
a words.json sense-set — and **no data from it is copied into any shipped
file**: not a word, not a count. Deleting `cache/` and rebuilding without
network access would change only which entries carry `"rare": true`.

Rejected alternatives: the Leipzig Corpora Collection Korean news set covers the
formal register better (it is the one corpus that would attest 익월) but ships
as a 255 MB archive under a non-commercial licence, which fails the
open/redistributable bar; `wordfreq`'s Korean data is msgpack inside a pip
package rather than a fetchable file; the NIKL (국립국어원) list needs
registration.

`cache/` is scratch — safe to delete, it just costs a re-download. Downloads use
`curl -C -` so an interrupted fetch resumes instead of starting over, and a file
whose size already matches the remote `Content-Length` is skipped entirely. The
190 MB JSONL is **streamed line by line** and never loaded into memory whole.
The Unihan zip is read in-place; nothing is extracted to disk.

## What it extracts

**Characters** — `lang_code: "ko"`, `pos: "character"`.

* *eumhun* from forms tagged `eumhun` (`"나라 국"` → hun `나라`, eum `국`) and from
  `ko-hanja` head templates (`{1: hun, 2: eum}`, or `{1: dict-form, 2: hun,
  3: eum}` as on 小, or `{1: eum}` alone on reading-only pages).
  **Normalized then deduped** per the SPEC addendum: wiktextract passes
  template markers through verbatim, so 韓 arrives as both `한국(韓國) 한` and
  `^한국(韓國) 한` — `^` is a capitalization flag, not content. `strip_markers`
  removes a leading `^`, `-` or `*` from hun and eum before the pair is keyed,
  so the duplicate collapses and 韓 comes out as exactly
  `[한국(韓國) 한, 나라 이름 한]`. Only 韓 and 漢 carry `^` today; the build asserts
  no marker survives anywhere.
* *readings* from forms tagged `hangeul`, `ko-hanja/old` `hangeul=` args, and the
  `sounds[].hangeul` pronunciation block. A single arg can pack several values
  and is split on `, 、 ; > /`: `설, 세, 열` is three readings, `벼슬 위; 다리미 울`
  is two full hun+eum pairs, and `륜>윤` is an initial-sound alternation where
  **both** are valid readings (580 args use `>`; before this split their
  readings were being dropped on the floor).
* *glosses* from `senses[].form_of[].extra` / `senses[].alt_of[].extra`
  (`"hanja form of 국 (“country; state; nation”)"` → `country; state; nation`),
  falling back to Unihan `kDefinition` for the ~5,300 reading-only pages that
  Wiktionary leaves undefined.

**Words** — three separate shapes, all of which matter:

1. hangul headword with a form tagged `hanja` (국민 → `國民`); a single form may
   carry several spellings (`美國/米國`).
2. **hanja headword** with the hangul in a form tagged `hangeul` (安全 → 안전).
   This is ~12,000 entries and is easy to miss entirely.
3. (hangul, hanja) pairs asserted in any entry's `derived` / `related` /
   `synonyms` list (`{word: "국민", alt: "國民"}`), for words with no page of
   their own.

**Variants** — merged from three sources.

*Korean Wiktionary*: "alternative form of" senses, and forms tagged
`alternative` on the canonical page (inverted).

*Unihan*: `kTraditionalVariant` (source → traditional), `kSimplifiedVariant`
*inverted* (value → source), `kZVariant`, `kSemanticVariant`.

*Translingual* (kaikki `mul` extract): Japanese shinjitai are **not** in Unihan
— it records PRC simplifications, not Japanese ones — and have no Korean
Wiktionary page, so 気/実/戦/続/楽 were unmappable without this source. English
Wiktionary does state the relationship, but on the Translingual section, which
the Korean-only extract cannot see. Two shapes carry it:

* `etymology_templates` `{"name": "Han simp", "args": {"1": "戰"}}` on the
  simplified page → 戦 → 戰.
* `related[]`, either tagged (實 → `{tags:[Japanese,shinjitai], word:実}`, so 実
  is the variant) or labelled (気 → `{alt:"Kyūjitai form of 気", word:氣}`, so 氣
  is the canonical). Ambiguous labels like "Variant form" are skipped rather
  than guessed at.

*Japanese* (ja.wiktionary `ja-extract.jsonl.gz`): the last source, needed for
characters Wiktionary classes as "simplified differently in Japan and China" —
図 among them — where no English-Wiktionary section states the link. ja
.wiktionary's 漢字 sections state it as prose in `etymology_texts`:
`図 → 「圖」の略体` ("abbreviated form of 圖"). Two shapes are read, `略体/略字/
新字体/俗字/変形` and the lower-confidence `異体字`. The match is **anchored to
the start of a sentence** and may not step over another bracketed character:
relation phrases also occur mid-sentence about *other* characters — 親's
etymology contains `（「新」の略字）`, which an unanchored regex would turn into
親 → 新. It contributes 95 winning mappings, 64 of which no other source
provides (亜→亞, 剣→劍, 単→單, 図→圖, 売→賣, 徳→德, 桜→櫻, 薬→藥, 覚→覺 …).

**Invariants** (all asserted every run). A mapping is kept only when the
canonical exists in `hanja.json`, the variant does **not** have its own
`hanja.json` entry, and the two differ. The never-shadow rule is deliberate and
load-bearing: 医 has a real Korean entry (동개 예, "quiver") that has nothing to
do with 醫, and 県 and 缶 likewise, so those stay unmapped even though a
shinjitai link exists. The output is also chain-free — no canonical is itself a
variant key — so the service worker's single-pass mapping is sufficient.

**Conflict resolution.** Sources are ranked (see `PRIO_*` in `build.py`):
Korean Wiktionary → Translingual `Han simp` → Unihan `kTraditionalVariant` →
ja `略体` → Translingual `related[]` → ja `異体字` → the remaining Unihan
fields. This order was tuned against the characters where two sources both name
a viable canonical. Within one source, ties are broken by how many sino-Korean
words in `words.json` actually contain the candidate — Unihan fields are
multi-valued (药 `kTraditionalVariant` = 葯 藥) and the first token is often not
the form Korean uses.

Every build prints the cases where the Japanese extract disagreed with the
winning source rather than letting them pass silently. No hand-curated mapping
table is used anywhere in this pipeline.

## Glosses are never truncated

Per the SPEC "No truncation" addendum, every gloss — char, compound and word —
is emitted in full. The build produces **no truncation marker at all**; visual
compactness is the UI's job (clamp + expander). An overlong sense is dropped
whole rather than cut.

Two filters sit in `clean_gloss`:

* **`GLOSS_MAX_CHARS = 600`** — a safety valve, not a style rule. The SPEC
  suggests ~400, but 400 silently dropped genuine definitions for 世襲巫 (407),
  降神巫 (418) and `-더-` (547), which is exactly the loss the addendum exists to
  prevent. 600 keeps every real definition; the longest surviving gloss in the
  shipped data is 418 chars.
* **`RE_GLOSS_ARTIFACT`** — 4,819 "senses" are really wiktextract dumping a
  reading table into the gloss field (`More information(eumhun reading: 하나 일
  (hana il)) (MC reading: …`, 728+ chars). These are matched by shape, not
  length, so the cap never has to do that job. Before this change they were
  being cut to 74 chars and shipped as junk.

A few glosses legitimately contain `…` from the source (Wiktionary's `[…]`
elision, and 點點點 which literally means "dot dot dot"), and four end in a
source `...` (一色, "all, totally, nothing but..."). The verify check therefore
tests for a **trailing U+2026**, the only marker this build ever emitted, and
reports the source ellipses separately instead of failing on them.

## The `rare` flag on words.json sense-sets

`"rare": true` marks a sense-set the frequency proxy cannot attest, so the UI
can hedge it. The key is omitted when false. It exists for the reverse-lookup
case: highlighting 사랑 ("love") should not surface 舍廊 ("hall in a traditional
house") as a confident match.

The hard part is that `ngram_freq` and `inbound` are keyed by **hangul**, so
homographs share them — 舍廊 inherits all 72 example-sentence hits belonging to
사랑 "love", and 牛李 inherits 우리's 313 hits from the native pronoun "we".
Only `alt_inbound` is keyed by the hanja spelling itself. So the build also
records `native_hangul`: every hangul that has a Korean entry with **no** hanja
spelling, i.e. a native word competing for that reading. Then:

```
rare = alt_inbound[spelling] < 2                        if hangul is native-contested
       alt_inbound == 0 and ngram == 0
                        and inbound == 0 and ext_freq == 0   otherwise
```

The `< 2` matters: 感謝 and 牛李 both have exactly one spelling-level reference
(a single character's derived list), and the only thing separating them is that
우리 is also a native word while 감사 is not. The external corpus is
hangul-keyed, so it is **deliberately not consulted on the contested branch** —
crediting 사랑's 771 subtitle hits to 舍廊 is exactly the mistake the branch
exists to prevent.

**Agglutination.** A Korean noun rarely appears bare in running text: 의중 has
zero occurrences as a token, while 의중을 / 의중에 / 의중대로 all occur. Counts
are therefore folded back onto the stem whenever the tail is in a closed list
of particles and light suffixes (`KO_PARTICLES`). The list is closed on
purpose — open prefix matching would credit 인도 for every occurrence of
인도네시아.

**Calibration.** 13.3% of sense-sets are flagged, down from 22.6% before the
external corpus. The predicate is deliberately conservative: a false positive
(hedging a correct, common match) is worse than a false negative. Two earlier
drafts are worth recording. The first also flagged any minority homograph
lacking its own `alt_inbound` — 30.2%, but it wrongly caught common secondary
readings 監査 "audit", 士氣 "morale", 修道, 史記, all now regression-guarded.
The second, Wiktionary-only, flagged real words that simply never appear in a
Wiktionary example sentence — 意中, 正史, 療養院 — which is what the external
list fixed.

**Known residual:** 翌月 (익월) is still flagged. It has zero attestation in
every accessible corpus — no occurrence in OpenSubtitles under any inflection,
no Korean Wikipedia article title, nothing in the Wiktionary example corpus. It
is a formal Sino-Korean term (contracts, banking) that subtitle and
encyclopedic registers do not cover, so the flag is arguably correct rather
than wrong. Obscure sino-sino homographs such as 靚飾 (정식) and 識度 (식도)
also go unflagged, because `alt_inbound` is too sparse to tell them apart from
監査.

`byHangul` lists all non-rare spellings before rare ones, so a reverse lookup
leads with a confident match; ordering within each group is unchanged.

## Romanization (`rr.json`) and the `f` frequency bucket

`pipeline/rr.py` turns hangul into Revised Romanization at build time, so the
runtime never has to invert a romanization. Every byHangul key and every
reading-index eum is indexed under three forms, identical ones collapsing:

| form | rule | 국민 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| naive | RR letters, positional, no cross-syllable change | `gukmin` |
| transliteration | RR Article 8: one fixed letter per jamo | `gugmin` |
| official | sound changes across syllable boundaries, then romanize | `gungmin` |

The official form applies ㄴ-insertion, linking (연음), palatalization, the ㅎ
rules (both merger directions and ㅎ-dropping before a vowel), coda
neutralization, nasalization and liquid assimilation. Tensification is not
marked, per the standard. Two of those are lexically, not phonologically,
determined — whether ㄴ-insertion applies at all (학여울 항녀울 but 금요일
그묘일) and which way a ㄴ+ㄹ boundary assimilates (신라 실라 but 신문로
신문노) — so both readings are indexed and only the anchor-bearing one is
called "the" official form. The standard's own examples are asserted every run
as binding anchors (백마 baengma … 국민 gungmin).

`f` on a words.json sense-set is a 0-9 frequency bucket, 0 = most frequent,
absent when the hangul is unranked. It is `floor(log4(rank))` clamped to 9,
over the hermitdave stem ranks the build already loads; the romanized-search
merge uses it to order two competing interpretations of a latin query.

## The character level taxonomy (`lvl`)

Every `hanja.json` entry carries exactly one of four levels. There is no
"unflagged" state — the field is universal, which is what lets the UI render
one chip per character instead of a badge that is sometimes absent.

| `lvl` | zone | source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `m` | MOE curriculum, middle school (중학교용) | Unihan membership ∩ wiki tier table |
| `h` | MOE curriculum, high school (고등학교용) | same |
| `a` | Advanced — outside the curriculum, genuinely in use | calibrated predicate |
| `r` | Rare — the archaic / specialist / reading-only tail | calibrated predicate |

Current distribution: **m 899, h 895, a 1,840, r 5,835** of 9,469 characters.
(The curriculum zones are 899/895 rather than 900/900 because six of the 1,800
have no Wiktionary or Unihan entry at all and so never enter the corpus.)

### The a/r predicate, and why it is shaped this way

`classify_level()` in `build.py` is the whole boundary; its two thresholds sit
directly above it for recalibration. School membership wins first and is never
overridden by usage. For everything else:

1. **Attested in a real word** — the character occurs in at least one
   `words.json` spelling that is not flagged `rare`. → `a`
2. **Own Wiktionary entry plus real compounds** — its glosses did *not* come
   from the Unihan `kDefinition` gap-fill, it has a native hun, and it appears
   in ≥ 2 words. → `a`
3. Otherwise → `r`

Rule 1 does the work (1,837 of the 1,840); rule 2 rescues exactly three
characters the corpus cannot vouch for but Wiktionary plainly can — 丕, 彬, 耀,
all common in personal names.

The reasoning behind rule 1 is that a character's own entry says very little
about whether the language *uses* it. The obvious predicates — "has a native
hun", "has ≥ 2 compounds" — promote dead CJK-Ext-A characters such as 㔏 ("to
divide; cut into pieces", zero words, zero corpus evidence) straight into `a`,
which is precisely what `a` must not contain. Usage is the discriminator, and
the pipeline already has a calibrated usage judgement: the `rare` flag on
words.json sense-sets. So the taxonomy reuses that decision wholesale rather
than inventing a second, unvalidated scale — which is also why the rare pass
now runs *before* `hanja.json` is built.

**Gloss provenance is tracked, never emitted.** The Unihan gap-fill records
which characters had to borrow their English gloss from `kDefinition`
(`unihan_only_gloss`); having no Korean Wiktionary entry of one's own is the
strongest single tail signal available, and it is what keeps rule 2 narrow.
The set stays internal to the build.

Anchors checked every run: 學/國/民 are `m`; 雰 (분위기), 祠 (사당), 娑 (娑婆),
膵, 腺, 癌, 鰐, 醬 are `a`; 㔏, 朞, 柶, 刋, 俴 are `r`. The build also prints a
fixed-seed 10 + 10 sample of the `a` and `r` zones on every run, so a
recalibration can be eyeballed without extra tooling.

## Character decomposition (`decomp.json`)

`pipeline/decomp.py` turns the BabelStone IDS file into the part list a
character card shows (依 = 亻 + 衣). One level deep: the parts are the
characters the picked IDS names, with the layout removed, because the card's
own glyph already shows the arrangement.

Per character the build picks the K (ROKorea) sequence where there is one,
else a G or untagged one, else the first; substitutes the `{n}` unencoded
components from the table in the file's own header; and drops the
decomposition on a mirror, rotation or subtraction operator, or on a `？` left
behind by an unrepresentable placeholder. A part above the BMP cannot be
trusted to render, so it is replaced by its own decomposition (乾 = 𠦝 + 乞
becomes 十 + 早 + 乞), depth-capped at 6, dropping the character if it will
not reduce.

Radical display forms alias to the character they stand for: NFKD covers the
two radical blocks (⺊ → 卜), a pinned table covers the forms encoded as
ordinary ideographs (亻 → 人). The alias decides what the row opens, not what
it shows — the card renders 亻, not 人 — except for an aliased part above the
BMP, where the target has to supply the display glyph as well (𥫗 → 竹).

A decomposition is emitted only if it has at least 2 parts and at least one
part the dictionary can open. That suppresses stroke soup (匕 = 乚 + ㇒) and
fully opaque splits; those cards simply have no Made of row. Parts with no
dictionary target carry a short name from Unihan `kDefinition` when there is
one, and are inert in the UI. Of 9,469 characters, 9,191 get an entry:
2 drop on an operator, 83 on a placeholder, 108 on skip-through, 85 on the
visibility rule.

## Korean definitions (`ko.json`)

`pipeline/urimalsaem.py` supplies the Korean definitions for the 한국어
language setting from 우리말샘 (NIKL's open dictionary, CC BY-SA 2.0 KR),
fetched from the spellcheck-ko/korean-dict-nikl mirror. The corpus is 25 XML
chunks, 1.73 GiB, one `<item>` per sense. It runs in three steps:

* **fetch** (`python pipeline/urimalsaem.py fetch`): reads the chunk list from
  the GitHub contents API, downloads each chunk with curl and stores it
  gzipped as `cache/urimalsaem/<name>.xml.gz` (~7.5 MB each, 182 MB total).
  Chunks already present are skipped, a partial download resumes, and an
  uncompressed chunk left in the directory is size-checked and gzipped in
  place. `--force` re-fetches everything; `build.py --force-download` does
  not touch this corpus.
* **preprocess** (`python pipeline/urimalsaem.py preprocess`, about 35 s):
  iterparses every chunk from gzip, never reads the `example_info` and
  `multimedia_info` subtrees (outside the license grant), applies the SPEC's
  sense selection (type 일반어 only; cross-reference stubs, the proper-noun
  categories 인명, 책명, 매체 and 고유명 일반, and the work or slang
  patterns "이 지은", "작사", "은어로" and the rest of the pinned list
  dropped; inline tags and the ⇒규범 표기 trailer removed) and keeps the
  first two survivors per headword and origin. One class survives: a 지명
  (place name) sense is dropped only when the same key has an ordinary
  sense, and a key with nothing else keeps it, which is how 中國 and 美國
  get their definitions while 生日 loses its village. That rule never
  applies to single characters, whose cards fall back to the hun. The
  Two more orderings: a surname sense ("우리나라 성(姓)의 하나", about
  520 senses corpus-wide) is kept but sorts after every other sense on
  its key, so 玉 leads with the stone and 姜 still shows the surname;
  and a root stub ("‘긴밀하다’의 어근.", the corpus files the meaning on
  the -하다 headword) is replaced in place by the first surviving sense
  of that headword with its sense code, so 緊密 reads 긴밀하다's
  definition and links its entry (about 7,500 stubs resolve, 120 with
  no target sense drop). The
  result is one file, `cache/urimalsaem/intermediate.json.gz` (~39 MB),
  with three lanes: hanja-origin senses keyed by the NFC hanja string,
  senses of every word that is not a pure hanja-origin word (word types
  고유어, 외래어, 혼종어) keyed by `hangul|pos` in Urimalsaem's own POS
  terms, and single-character senses keyed by the character. It also
  collects the definitions named by `KO_OVERRIDES`. Rerun it only when the
  mirror updates or the override table changes.
* **build** (inside `build.py`): reads only the intermediate. On a cold cache
  it runs fetch and preprocess itself. Hanja senses match `words.json` keys
  directly, else through `variants.json` (絕對 reaches 絶對), else through a
  glyph-form equivalence built from Unihan's kZVariant, kSemanticVariant,
  kSpecializedSemanticVariant and kTraditionalVariant fields, minus the
  financial numerals 壹貳參肆伍陸柒捌玖拾 and every simplification pair
  that is not one-to-one (谷 stands for 穀 and for itself, so 穀/谷 is
  out; 状 stands for 狀 alone, so 狀/状 stays), substituting one
  character per position. A direct match always wins and a variant match
  never touches a directly decorated key; the reverse also runs: a
  directly decorated key fans out to every glyph-twin key that has no
  direct decoration (映畫 decorates 映畵, 狀態 decorates 状態, 祕密
  decorates 秘密), and a twin claimed by two different direct keys stays
  undecorated. The `hangul|pos` lane matches
  `native.json` rows through the pinned POS table (명사 and 의존 명사 to
  `noun`, 동사 and 보조 동사 to `verb`, and so on; any other POS never
  matches); single characters match `hanja.json` characters through
  `variants.json`. `KO_OVERRIDES` in `urimalsaem.py` then replaces the
  computed definitions of a key with the listed Urimalsaem sense codes, in
  order (seeded with 韓國, whose 대한민국 sense the corpus files under 지명
  behind the 대한 제국 abbreviation); an override whose code is missing or
  that changes nothing aborts the build, the same discipline as
  `NOT_RARE_OVERRIDES`. Every emitted key must exist in the file it
  decorates or the build aborts. The verify step anchors 學生, 學校, 家族,
  生日, 學, 江, 우리, 契丹, 中國 and the other place names, 韓國, 麥, 히어로
  and the ko-less 生覺, and prints the coverage report with the glyph-form
  rescues and the ten most frequent keys still lacking a Korean definition.

## Canonical words keys, and how long a key can be

The service worker NFC-normalizes a selection and maps every character through
`variants.map` **before** it touches `words`, so a shipped key that is not
itself canonical is either unreachable or a silent redirect. Both happened: 131
keys (e.g. 中腦, whose 腦 legitimately maps to 匘 because 腦 has no hanja.json
entry) resolved to nothing, and 130 more (一舉兩得 → 一擧兩得) answered from a
different record.

So the build canonicalizes every key at emission, which forces the pipeline
order **variants → words → hanja**: `variants.json` is built first, from the
character data alone (a canonical must have a hanja.json entry, and a variant
must not), and its map then re-keys the word buckets. Source spellings that
collapse onto one key merge with the same semantics used everywhere else:
glosses deduped through `push_gloss`, `hp` any-wins, score max, hangul senses
merged per hangul; `rare` needs no rule because it is derived after the merge.
`byHangul` values, `cw` indexes and compound rows all use the canonical keys.
Current effect: 27,759 source spellings → 27,627 keys (261 re-keyed, 132
absorbed into an existing record). The variant-map tie-break (`canon_rank`)
counts pre-canonical spellings, since it runs before the re-keying; it is a
heuristic between equal-priority sources, not a correctness input.

`words.json` also carries top-level **`maxWordLen`** and **`maxHangulLen`** —
the longest keys actually shipped (both 11: 朝鮮民主主義人民共和國 /
조선민주주의인민공화국). `lookup.js` segments up to those lengths; its `6`
constants are now only the fallback for a bundle without the fields. With the
old hardcoded 6, all 30 hanja keys and 31 byHangul keys longer than that came
back as fragments instead of whole words.

## Compound ranking

`compounds` per character is a reverse index over `words.json` capped at 8, one
row per hangul reading. Wiktionary carries no frequency data, so ranking uses a
composite proxy:

* **corpus frequency** — every hangul 2–4-gram in all ~9,800 Wiktionary example
  sentences is counted; a word scores on how often its hangul spelling occurs.
  This is the strongest available signal and dominates the ranking.
* **inbound references** — how many entries link to the word.
* **`alt_inbound`** — inbound references keyed by *hanja spelling* rather than
  hangul; this is what separates homographs (國家 vs 國歌, both 국가).
* **entry richness** — senses, examples, synonyms, derived terms, etymology.
* modest bonuses for being on the character's own Wiktionary "derived terms"
  list and for appearing on several such lists; a penalty per character beyond
  two.

See "Known approximations" in the build report for what this does and does not
get right.

## Verification

Every run ends with counts, output sizes, and spot-checks:

* 國 has eumhun 나라/국, a "country" gloss, and 국민/國民 among its compounds.
* 国→國, 学→學, and the shinjitai set 気→氣 実→實 図→圖 戦→戰 続→續 楽→樂 広→廣.
* `rare` anchors: 國民/學校/資本主義/感謝/士氣/史記/監査/修道/意中/正史/療養院
  not rare, 舍廊 and 牛李 rare, and `byHangul` ordering puts non-rare
  spellings first.
* No gloss anywhere ends in `…`, and 韓's eumhun is exactly
  `[한국(韓國) 한, 나라 이름 한]` with no marker left in any hun or eum.
* 医, 県, 缶 keep their own Korean entries and stay **unmapped** (regression
  guard on the never-shadow invariant).
* 國民 → 국민 in `words`, and 國民 in `byHangul[국민]`.
* Every `words` key is variant-canonical (canonicalizing it is a no-op),
  `byHangul` points only at existing keys, `cw`/compound spellings are
  canonical too, and the two re-keyed anchors survive: 中腦→中匘 keeps 중뇌 and
  一舉兩得 exists only as 一擧兩得.
* `maxWordLen` / `maxHangulLen` match a recomputation over the shipped keys.
* Every character has exactly one valid `lvl` and no legacy `edu`/`eduT`
  field; the zone sizes sit in their expected bands; the a/r boundary anchors
  hold; 學/國/民 are middle school.
* 20 very common characters are present, including 文/金/小/中/時, which use an
  older template shape (`alt-of` senses pointing at a hangul reading) that a
  naive parser silently drops.

* `decomp.json` anchors: 依 = 亻(→人) + 衣, 或 = 戈 + 口 + 一, 克 = 十 + 兄
  (the K pick), 誨 = 訁(→言) + 每, 乾 = 十 + 早 + 乞 and 疑 = 匕 + 矢 + 龴 + 疋
  (skip-through), 飮 = 食 + 欠 and 學 = 臼 + 爻 + 冖 + 子 (above-BMP aliases);
  無, 乙 and 一 have no entry. Over the whole file: every part is in the BMP,
  no IDC, operator, placeholder or `？` survives, every entry has 2+ parts and
  a dictionary part, and every stated target exists in `hanja.json`.

A failed check exits non-zero.

## Store screenshots

```sh
python make_screenshots.py
```

Regenerates all nine numbered shots in `screenshots/` (the promotional tiles
are `make_promo.py`, which is unrelated). Every shot is 1280x800 24-bit RGB
with no alpha, which is what the store accepts.

`--only 3,8` limits the run to those shot numbers; `--keep-temp` leaves the
working directory behind. Nothing is written until every shot has passed every
assertion, so a broken run leaves the committed set alone.

### Why there are staging pages

Chrome 151 headless ignores `--load-extension`. There is no way to have the
real extension inject itself into a real page in a headless capture, and a
headful capture cannot be scripted to a stable pixel.

So `pipeline/screenshots/shots-page.html` and `shots-panel.html` stage the
scenes instead. They are not mockups. Each one loads the **real** extension
code — `extension/lookup.js`, `extension/saved.js`,
`extension/content/content.js`, the sidepanel scripts, the shipped stylesheet,
the shipped `extension/data/*.json` — behind `__hanjaHoverTestRuntime`, the
message-transport stub those scripts already accept in place of
`chrome.runtime` (the same hook `test-page/embed.html` uses). The panel page
copies the sidepanel markup verbatim, ids and all, and seeds an in-memory saved
store where `chrome.storage` would be. It also imports `extension/background.js`
itself for the decomposition join, so the Made of rows and the Part of count are
the worker's own output over the shipped `decomp.json` rather than a second
implementation of them (every `chrome.*` touch in that file is already guarded,
so importing it into a plain page is safe). Selections are real DOM ranges handed to
the content script's own `handleSelection()`; the popup is sized by the
product's own `resizePanel`, the code path a drag runs. Every pixel of UI in
the output is the product rendering itself.

The script serves the repo root over http on a free port, because the staging
pages use ES modules and `fetch`, neither of which works from `file://`. It
drives one headless Chrome over CDP, one tab per shot, using a small websocket
client written into `make_screenshots.py` — stdlib plus PIL, no Node and no pip
installs. The viewport is always set **before** navigation: `content.js` hides
the popup on resize, so a viewport that changes afterwards captures an empty
page.

### What is asserted

Per shot, before the pixels are kept:

* the scene signalled `data-shot-ready`, and its DOM checks pass — the popup is
  up, the card headline is the expected hanja, the breadcrumb trail exists, the
  variant note reads `学生 → 學生`, the settings view mounted, and so on;
* the image is exactly 1280x800, mode RGB, with no transparency key;
* for the two shots whose point is the corner seal, the seal is actually
  visible in the lower-right of the panel (the room rule hides it when the view
  is full, so this is a real failure mode).

### Adding a scene

1. Add the markup to `shots-page.html` (a new article block, shown for your
   scene id) or a new query parameter to `shots-panel.html`, then extend the
   scene switch at the bottom of that file. Signal readiness by leaving
   `document.documentElement.dataset.shotReady` set, which the driver waits on.
2. Add an entry to `SHOTS` in `make_screenshots.py`: `kind` is `page` for a
   whole-viewport capture or `composite` for a page docked beside a 360px side
   panel, `page` and `panel` are the staging query strings, and `checks` are JS
   expressions that must every one evaluate `true` before anything is captured.
3. Run `python make_screenshots.py --only <n>` and look at the result.

The `scroll` in each scene is the page offset that frames it; the `bottom` is
how much page to leave visible under the popup, which is what decides how much
of a long list the popup shows.

## Browser self-checks, headless

```sh
python pipeline/run_selfchecks.py            # both pages; --page index|embed, --port N, --keep
```

Runs `test-page/index.html` and `test-page/embed.html` in headless Chrome on the
shared CDP client in `cdp.py`, prints the check count per page and every
failing check by name, and exits non-zero on any failure. Header docstring has
the details.
